	% BuildFace:										  
	%   Completes a single Face struct with already but empty fields. 
	%   Its fields are:
	%		- ij            : Cells that have Face in contact
	%       - globalIds     : globalId (UNVECTORIZED) for the face centre
	%		- InterfaceType : Integer. If the face is facing the substrate
	%		another cell or the lumen 
	%		- Centre        : Face centre 
	%       - Edges         : Local indices of the vertices forming the 
	%		face. That is Geo.Cells(c).Y(Edges(e,:),:) will give vertices
	%       defining the edge. Used also for triangle computation
	% Input:															  
	%   ci   : index for cell i
	%   cj   : index for cell j
	%   Cell : Cell object
	%   XgID : Nodal Ids for ghost nodes
	%   Set  : User Defined settings
	% Output:															  
	%   Face : Face struct with filled data
