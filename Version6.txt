Versions of Netwrok Code (3D vertex)

   % Geometery: seeding nodes 
   % Volume Energy:
   % surface energy: Area-Cellbased/Facebased/TrianguleBased
   % Energy barrier to protect samll triangules: exponential/Log 
  

1.0: % Remodeling included

5.0: 
  % surfaces-centers with 3 vertices are removed
  % 4-4 flip
  % substrate 
  % three examples( stretch-compression-extrusion)

6.0: 
% Remodelling of vertices using center line through nodes and mean positions of vertices.
% Nodes are centered on coordinate (0,0,0)

6.1. Corrected Set.Defaults
